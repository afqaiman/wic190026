# TUTORIAL 1

## Build the pseudocode and flow chart for each of the problems: (Part I)

### 1. Request two numbers from the user and print the multiplication of the numbers.

user input first number

user input second number

answer = first number* second number

print answer

<>


### 2. Determine whether a random number is greater than 50.

generate a random number

if the number >50, print "greater than 50"

else, print "not geater than 50"

### 3. Print the pass/fail grade based on the mark entered by user. The passing mark is at least 40.

user input a mark

if mark <40, print "fail"

else, print "pass"

### 4. Print the results of the two players’ dice game.

input first player dice number

input second number dice number

print first player dice number

print second player dice number


### 5. Print the perimeter of a rectangle.

input the width of the rectangle

input the length of the rectangle

perimeter=width+width+length+length

print perimeter

### 6. Print the minimum number from 10 random numbers generated by computer.

set x=1

x must <= 10

generate a random number

print number

x++

### 7. Print the number of odd and even number from 10 random numbers generated by computer. The random number must be from 10 – 100.

set x=1

x must <= 10

generate y (random number)

if y>9 && y<101, continue

else, regenerate y again

if y%2=0, print "even"

else, print "odd"

x++
